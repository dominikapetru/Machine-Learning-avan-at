Natural gas prices have surged in Europe as countries exit COVID-19 lockdown, fuelling a crisis that is likely to impact consumers' bills this winter. 

The cost is now six times higher than what it was last year in Europe and is continuing to increase, with the crisis unlikely to abate before the spring.

Governments are scrambling to issue subsidies and cut taxes in an effort to protect consumers.

Here are five charts to help you visualise what's going on.

The price of natural gas is six times higher than last year and about four times higher than this past spring.


It's due to an increase in demand globally as countries restart their economies and come out of lockdown. A longer winter last year and competition from East Asian countries for gas has influenced rising prices.

There are also problems on the supply end, with delayed maintenance and less investment causing problems.

These gas prices are in turn determining the price in electricity markets, as over a fifth of Europe's electricity comes from natural gas.
